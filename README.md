This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built on top of the VGG16 transfer-learning architecture. The model processes MRI scans by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the images, then uses the pretrained VGG16 convolutional base to extract deep features relevant for tumor identification. A custom classifier is added on top to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor cases, and the model is trained using binary cross-entropy loss with the Adam optimizer. The accompanying Jupyter Notebook walks through data loading, preprocessing, model construction, training, and evaluation, providing accuracy and loss curves along with classification metrics. This project aims to offer a simple and effective deep-learning approach for early brain tumor detection.
